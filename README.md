# About this project

The file here are from a project I done for PHYS4061 where I needed to simulate a crystal structure. The lab1 to lab3 contain different version of the code as we are required to code this project not in once but over multiple step.

## Lab1
It is for coding the generation of the crystal, that include simple cubic(SC), Face-Centered Cubic (FCC), body-centered cubic (BCC) and diamond cubic(DC).

## lab2

It is for some useful function. Including convertion between primitive vector and reciprocal vector and finding the nearest neightbor.

## lab3
Using the above function, the program can simulate the total energy of the crystal using different potential which can be compared to experimental value.
